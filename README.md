🎓 Student Pass/Fail Prediction

This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on their study habits and related factors such as study hours, attendance, assignments, sleep, and parental education background.

The project compares the performance of two machine learning models:

🌳 Random Forest Classifier

📊 Naïve Bayes Classifier

📌 Project Overview

Trains and evaluates machine learning models using student study habit data.

Compares model accuracy (Random Forest vs. Naïve Bayes).

Makes predictions for new students based on given features.

🗂 Dataset

The dataset (student_study_habits.csv) contains the following features:

study_hours_per_week → Number of hours a student studies per week.

attendance_percentage → Attendance rate in percentage.

assignments_completed → Number of assignments completed.

sleep_hours_per_day → Average daily sleep hours.
